            Although various educational institutions want to attract students,
            they cannot indulge in hard selling. It needs to be communicated
            subtly to students and their parents and guardians why they should

            websites to draw students and parents. For that, many school and
            college websites these days have dedicated blogs and FAQ sections
            that are regularly updated.

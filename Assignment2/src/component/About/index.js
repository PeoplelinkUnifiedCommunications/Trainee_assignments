                            Though Vijayawada grew as one of the major cities in Andhra Pradesh with accelerated trade, commerce, industry and political enlightenment,
                             there were very few educational institutions of repute four decades ago. Hence the idea of establishing a premiere educational complex had been incubating in
                              the minds of the philanthropic elite of Vijayawada for a long time which materialized into concrete reality in 1975 through the synergy of 250 educated and visionary
                               people drawn from different noble professions to establish the “Academy of General and Technical Education.”
